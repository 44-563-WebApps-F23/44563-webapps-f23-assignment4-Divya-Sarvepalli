        <h1>Divya acts in a play</h1>
        <p>
            <h4>Name of the Play: Hedda Gabler </h4>
            <h4>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h4><br>
            <p>ACT FOURTH.<br>

              <p> The same rooms at the TESMANS'.  It is evening.  The drawing-
                room is in darkness.  The back room is lighted by the hanging
                lamp over the table.  The curtains over the glass door are
                drawn close.</p><br>
              
              <p> HEDDA, dressed in black, walks to and fro in the dark room.
                Then she goes into the back room and disappears for a moment
                to the left.  She is heard to strike a few chords on the
                piano.  Presently she comes in sight again, and returns to
                the drawing-room.</p><br>
              
                BERTA enters from the right, through the inner room, with a
                lighted lamp, which she places on the table in front of the
                corner settee in the drawing-room.  Her eyes are red with
                weeping, and she has black ribbons in her cap.  She goes
                quietly and circumspectly out to the right.  HEDDA goes up
                to the glass door, lifts the curtain a little aside, and
                looks out into the darkness.
              
                Shortly afterwards, MISS TESMAN, in mourning, with a bonnet
                and veil on, comes in from the hall.  HEDDA goes towards her
                and holds out her hand.
              
              
              MISS TESMAN.
              
              Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
              has at last found peace.
              
              
              HEDDA.
              
              I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.
              
              
              MISS TESMAN.
              
              Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
              Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
              death.
              
              
              HEDDA.
              
              That was very kind of you.
              
              
              MISS TESMAN.
              
              Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
              Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
              
              
              HEDDA.
              
              [Changing the subject.] She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
              Tesman?
              
              
              MISS TESMAN.
              
              Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
              happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
              not come home yet?
              
              
              HEDDA.
              
              No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?
              
              
              MISS TESMAN.
              
              No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much
              to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She
              shall go to her grave looking her best.
              
              
              HEDDA.
              
              Can I not help you in any way?
              
              
              MISS TESMAN.
              
              Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
              mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.
              
              
              HEDDA.
              
              One is not always mistress of one's thoughts--
              
              
              MISS TESMAN.
              
              [Continuing.] Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
              sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but
              of another sort, thank God!
              
              
                GEORGE TESMAN enters by the hall door.
